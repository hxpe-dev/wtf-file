## ü§î What is this?

Ever cloned a repo and wondered what `.nvmrc`, `.browserslistrc`, or `.editorconfig` actually do?

**`wtf`** is a zero-config CLI tool that tells you exactly what these files are, in plain English, right from your terminal.

```bash
npx wtf .nvmrc
# => WTF is .nvmrc
# => ‚Üí Specifies the Node.js version. Used by nvm to automatically switch versions.
# => Want to know more? https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

npx wtf
# => Auto-detects files in your project root and explains them.
```
